AI-Powered Quantum-Resilient DCA Management System


This project reimagines enterprise Debt Collection Agency (DCA) Management by replacing traditional, fragmented workflows with a secure, automated, and intelligent ecosystem. Designed to address critical pain points like manual case allocation and lack of audit transparency, the system integrates cutting-edge AI/ML models with Post-Quantum Cryptography to future-proof financial data against emerging cyber threats.

Core Solutions & Innovations
Predictive Recovery Engine: Implements advanced machine learning (XGBoost/LightGBM) to generate a Dynamic Priority Score for thousands of overdue accounts, identifying high-probability recovery cases to optimize resource allocation.

Post-Quantum Identity Security: Integrates quantum-resistant algorithms and digital signatures to secure device and user identities, ensuring that sensitive financial and government-level communication remains impenetrable even to future supercomputers.

Immutable Governance via Blockchain: Leverages a private blockchain to create a tamper-proof audit trail for all case closures and DCA interactions, enforcing strict compliance with SOPs and SLAs.

Agentic AI Compliance Auditor: Utilizes local Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically audit communication logs between agencies and debtors, flagging non-compliant behavior and ensuring ethical collection practices.

Real-time Strategic Dashboards: A centralized visualization command center that provides enterprise-level stakeholders with deep insights into recovery predictability, DCA performance, and overall system security health.
